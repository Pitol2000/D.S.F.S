# Data Science From Scratch
_Data Science From Scratch 2nd Edition_ is a book by
Joel grus, O'REILLY. This is a book for people who are interested in learning Data Science, specially with Python. 

In this repository, it will contain all (or most of) the coding exercises/learning that this book has.

Keep in mind that most of the code will need Python Libraries, such as _matplotlib_, _pandas_, etc. The book has basic instructions on how to create your enviroment. Here are some:

---
Download and install Anaconda from the website. You can also use other enviroments, such as venv and virtualenv. Here we'll cover Anaconda, because it's not hard to use:

1. Firstly, make sure you have Python and Pip installed, then download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. Follow their inscructions about the installation. There are also a lot of helpful YouTube tutorials.
3. After installation, create an enviroment called whatever you like. Here we'll call dsfs
    ```
    conda create -n dsfs
    ```
4. If you did everything correctly, you'll be into that enviroment when you type
    ```
    # Activate the enviroment
    conda activate dsfs

    # Deactivate
    conda deactivate
    ```
